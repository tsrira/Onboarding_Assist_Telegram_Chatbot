## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Vector Creation (Content Ingestion)
- Watches Google Drive for the onboarding PDF
- Splits content into chunks
- Generates OpenAI embeddings
- Stores chunks as vectors in **Pinecone**

### 2️⃣ Telegram Assistant Workflow
- Listens for new messages on Telegram
- Matches query against vector store (contextual search)
- Uses OpenAI to summarize matching answer
- Replies in chat or responds:  
  `"Sorry! I can't find relevant information from the knowledge base."`
